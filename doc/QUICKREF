SIMPLESEM QUICK-REFERENCE
=========================

Basics
------

instruction pointer (ip) -- which keeps track of /the/ next instruction
memory D[]: data memory 
memory C[]: code memory, -- all instruction fit in one element and ip is and 
                            index into C
read = input register
write = output register
writeln = output register that insert a newline at the end of each write

# begin an inline comment


Instructions
------------

set target, source

Examples 
set 10, D[20] # D[10] = D[20]
set 30, read  # reads value into D[30]
set writeln, D[5] + D[6] # prints sum

jump address

Examples
jump 10	# next instruction at C[10]
jump ip + 4 # next instruction at C[ip + 4]

jumpt address, condition

Example
jumpt 40, D[20] < 100

indirect addressing (references)
set D[10], 0	# D[D[10]] = 0
jump D[10]	# ip = D[10]
