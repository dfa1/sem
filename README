- make

  $ make                                # build sem 

This creates an executable `sem'; to install in `/usr/local/bin', first
become root and then `make install' 

[ Become root if necessary ] %
make install # install sem and misc/semd

  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make uninstall                      # remove sem and semd 


What's sem anyway?
------------------

Sem is an interpreter and a debugger for the SIMPLESEM language.   

"We said that in this book we will use an operational approach to semantics.
To do so, we introduce a simple abstract processor called SIMPLESEM, and we
show constructs can be executed by sequences of operations of the abstract
processor."

How to use misc/sem.vim? 
------------------------

The file sem.vim is a Vim syntax file. It enables Vim to show parts of 
the text in another font or color for your .sem files.

Copy the sem.vim in /usr/share/vim/vim{version}/syntax. Then edit your
/usr/share/vim/vim{version}/filetype.vim and add the following lines:

" SIMPLESEM 
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sem                     setf sem
